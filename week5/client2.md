### Task: A web page that polls the server for data at intervals and updates the page when the data changes:

Assuming that we receive the data in 3 different objects, we will be focusing on two major functions:

* A function to request the data from the server. We will be using a jQuery getJSON function to do this. However, it is possible to use an open connection but we will not be doing this today due to time constrictions. 

* A function to search and compare the tweets' content (text) and the number of retweets (retweet count). 

We are also considering including the favourited count depending on time. 

We will be presenting to group 4, three separate objects corressponding to the hashtags #stop #go #continue. Every new tweet will be saved in an object and held within the parent object with the appropirate hashtag.

## Group three is awesome!
