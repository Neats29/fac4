#Graph:
 * Bar chart - vertical
 * Height & colour - proportional to number of tweets
 * 3 bar charts - one for each hashtag 
    * One svg for bar chart
 * 3 radio buttons to toggle between charts
    * Button switches dataset and redraws chart
 * Suggestions in svg text element below chart
 * Hover over bar displays suggestion text
 * Optional sort button to sort 
 
#Questions:
 * What should it look like: see above
 * What data do we need:
    * Suggestion text
    * Retweet count
    * Which hashtag
 * How often are we getting updates?
    * We are assuming we will get data and populate graph in the response callback - We will define our drawing function elsewhere then pass it as a callback to the response processing function.
 * How are we going to store data?
  * Each suggestion type will be stored in a separate dataset.
 
#Stretch:
 * Instead of radio buttons, use a carousel or tabs, etc
 * Change how suggestion is displayed:
    * have vertical/horizontal bars
    * have a suggestion text element below the chart
    * hovering over bar will highlight the suggestion text element and vice versa
 * Timer bar on top
 * Pie chart
 * Force diagram
